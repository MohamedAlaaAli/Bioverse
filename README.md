## 1. Introduction

This README provides an overview of the solution I developed for the BioVerse Hackathon. The solution is based on a Prototypical Network with a ResNet18 backbone, designed to address a image classification challenge within the hackathon.

## 2. Solution Overview

The BioVerse Hackathon challenge posed a unique problem that required few-shot learning capabilities to make predictions and classifications in the bioinformatics domain. To tackle this problem, I implemented a Prototypical Network architecture, utilizing the powerful ResNet18 as the backbone.

Key components of the solution:

- **Prototypical Network**: This approach involves training a network to understand the relationship between data points in an embedding space. It excels in few-shot learning tasks by learning a prototype for each class and assigning new examples to the class with the closest prototype.

- **ResNet18 Backbone**: The ResNet18 architecture is used as a feature extractor. Its deep architecture helps in capturing meaningful features from the bioinformatics data, improving the overall performance of the network.

## 3. Requirements

Before using this solution, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Your specific dataset and annotations (refer to the dataset used during the hackathon)

## 4. Training

To train the Prototypical Network with the ResNet18 backbone on your specific dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is organized with proper annotations for few-shot learning.

2. Configure the training settings: Modify the training hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

3. Train the model

4. Monitor training: Use TensorBoard or inspect the training logs to monitor the training progress.

## 5. Inference

To perform inference and make predictions using the trained model:

1. Load the trained model checkpoint.

2. Prepare a few-shot query set or individual samples.

3. Use the trained model to compute the prototypes and make predictions based on the few-shot query.


## 6. Acknowledgments
